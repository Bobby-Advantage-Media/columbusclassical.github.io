								<h2>About</h2>
							</header>
							<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
							<h3>Our Mission</h3>

							<p>To train the mind and develop the character of each student according to a rigorous, integrated and content-rich, liberal arts curriculum from the Western, classical tradition in an academic setting that honors and inculcates moral, intellectual and civic virtue.</p>

							<h3>Our Vision</h3>

							<p>To form wise and virtuous American citizens who seek the truth, love what is beautiful, and do what is good.</p>


							<h3>About</h3>

							<p>Columbus Classical Academy is a community (charter) school founding project led by dedicated parents and concerned citizens in Central Ohio who believe that modern schooling in America has lost sight of the proper purposes of a formal education: The teaching of intellectual, moral and civic virtue.</p>

							<p>As a Hillsdale College Candidate Member School, CCA enjoys the support of the Barney Charter School Initiative, which assists groups of local citizens with the launch and operation of classical K-12 charter schools in their communities all around the country. That support includes access to the extraordinarily rich and academically rigorous K-12 American classical curriculum that Hillsdale has developed, as well as consultation and training for boards, administrators and teachers at no cost to its member schools.</p>

							<p>A curriculum guide overview of the material taught at each grade in Hillsdale member schools is available <a href="Curriculum-Overview-Packet_v2.2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

							<p>Columbus Classical Academy is currently on track to open its doors in the fall of 2023 to students in grades K-5, adding a grade each year, up to grade twelve. It will be public, tuition free, open to any student who is eligible to attend any public school in Ohio (space permitting), and will be located in the Columbus metro area.</p>

Sed quidquid est realiter in Deo, de ipso praedicari potest. Ergo relatio non est realiter in Deo.</p>

							<p>Praeterea, dicit Boetius in eodem libro, quod similis est relatio in Trinitate Patris ad Filium, et utriusque ad Spiritum Sanctum, ut eius quod est idem, ad id quod est idem. Sed huiusmodi relatio est rationis tantum: quia omnis relatio realis exigit duo extrema realiter. Ergo relationes quae ponuntur in divinis, non sunt reales relationes, sed rationis tantum.</p>

							<p>Praeterea, relatio paternitatis est relatio principii. Sed cum dicitur, Deus est principium creaturarum, non importatur aliqua relatio realis, sed rationis tantum. Ergo nec paternitas in divinis est relatio realis. Et eadem ratione nec aliae relationes quae ponuntur ibi.</p>

							</header>
							<details><summary class="question">What is a “classical” education?</summary><br>
								<p>Classical education is, above all, the teaching of virtue. It was the prevailing philosophy of education in the West for over 2000 years, from Plato and Aristotle and continuing through the American founding until around the turn of the twentieth century. Classical education values knowledge for its own sake; maintains that truth, beauty and goodness are objective; upholds standards of correctness and excellence; develops moral virtue in its students; and prepares them to be responsible citizens in their political community.</p>

							</details>


							<details><summary class="question">What will students be taught?</summary><br>
								<p>CCA will use the Hillsdale College K-12 classical curriculum, which includes:

									<ul>	
										<li>Core Knowledge history and geography</li>
										<li>Classical literature and philosophy from the Western canon</li>
										<li>Singapore math</li>
										<li>Core Knowledge science</li>
										<li>Explicit grammar and phonics</li>
										<li>American civics</li>
										<li>Latin</li>
										<li>Music and the arts</li>
										<li>Physical education</li>
									</ul>

									<p>A more complete curriculum guide overview is available <a href="Curriculum-Overview-Packet_v2.2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary class="question">When will the school open?</summary><br>
									<p>CCA is on track to open in the fall of 2024.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary class="question">Who can attend?</summary><br>
									<p>Any student who resides in Ohio is eligible to enroll space permitting.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary class="question">What will it cost?</summary><br>
									<p>Tuition information will be available soon.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary class="question">Where will the school be located?</summary><br>
									<p>The school will be located in the Columbus metro area. The founders are in the process of identifying possible sites for the school, based on facility size and suitability, acreage, safety, accessibility and desirability of location, as well as cost.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary class="question">Who will be the principal, teachers and staff?</summary><br>
									<p>The founders anticipate hiring the principal or headmaster in the late summer or early fall of 2023.  Once the principal is hired, that individual will be responsible for the recruitment and hiring of teachers and staff for the school.</p>

									<p>If you have any interest in a position with CCA and are qualified to teach or serve in an administrative capacity, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> the founders.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary class="question">What can I do to support the opening of the school?</summary><br>
									<p>There are at least three ways that you can help:</p>

									<ol>
										<li><strong>Donate</strong> – opening a new school requires significant, up-front capital to pay for:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Facility lease or purchase and renovations</li>
											<li>Desks, classroom supplies, and administrative office needs</li>
											<li>Legal, consulting, and marketing fees</li>
											<li>Principal and teacher salaries prior to opening</li>
										</ul>

										<p>If you are willing and able to donate or pledge your financial support for the school, please visit the <a href="#Contribute">Contribute page</a>.</p>

										<li><strong>Spread the word</strong> – let your friends, neighbors and colleagues know about CCA, including by sending an email to them with a link to our website, so that they can learn more about the school and how to support it.</li>

										<li><strong>Volunteer</strong> – if you have time and expertise in the field(s) of education, marketing, real estate, finance, or are just a concerned parent or citizen who would like to be more involved in the founding effort, be sure to <a href="#contact">Contact us</a> and include in your message that you would like to explore ways to become more actively involved.</li>

									</ol>

								</details>

								<details><summary class="question">How much money needs to be raised in order for the school to open?</summary><br>
									<p>Our goal is to raise $2 million in funds and pledges by the time the school opens in the fall of 2024. Although CCA likely could open its doors on a smaller budget, a strong fundraising campaign will expand the facility options and position the school especially well to grow significantly as it serves more grades each year. However, whatever amount we are able to raise, CCA is committed to opening in 2024 if at all possible.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary class="question">Is CCA a tax exempt 501(c)(3) organization?</summary><br>
									<p>The application for tax exempt status is in process. See the <a href="#Contribute">Contribute page</a> for details.</p>
