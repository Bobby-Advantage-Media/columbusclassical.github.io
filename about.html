						<!-- <p>Questions...</p> -->



						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">Where is CCA located?</strong><br>
						<p>CCA is based in Columbus, OH. We are currently working to finalize our location and will publish an update to our <a href="#subscribe">email list</a> when available.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">How much is tuition?</strong><br>
						<p>Please see our <a href="admissions.html#tuition">Admissions page</a> for information about enrollment and tuition.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">How do I enroll?</strong><br>
						<p>Enrollment for the 2023–2024 academic year will open in October 2022. For more information, please see our <a href="admissions.html#enrollment">Enrollment page</a>. If you are interested in enrollment, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOmL3cAU14pSVnkVkozuEpvnpl_txdjY6LtDJXmNjwc3svog/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this survey</a>.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">When will CCA open?</strong><br>
						<p>We eagerly anticipate welcoming our first students for the 2023-2024 academic year!</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">What grades does CCA serve?</strong><br>
						<p>CCA initially serves grades K-8. We will add one grade each year until K-12 is served.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">What positions are you hiring?</strong><br>
						<p>We are hiring multiple faculty and positions. See <a href="index.html#careers">here</a> for more information.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">I’ve heard about a classical charter school opening in Columbus, is this CCA?</strong><br>
						<p>No. CCA is a private school, meaning we are completely independent from state support. Following Hillsdale's example, CCA will never accept government funding or loans. There is a classical charter school, also opening in fall of 2023, called <a href="https://heartofohioclassical.org/" target="_blank">Heart of Ohio Classical Academy</a> (HOCA). We are very supportive of HOCA's work, and are glad that there is another classical school opening in Columbus. CCA and HOCA are both affiliated with Hillsdale College. CCA is a Hillsdale College Curriculum School, while HOCA is a Hillsdale College Member School. Both CCA and HOCA use the Hillsdale College curriculum and both are classical. Our main differences will be private vs. chartered, our locations (we are different schools), and the type of behind-the-scenes support received from Hillsdale.</p>

						<strong style = "font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;font-variant:small-caps;">How can I stay updated?</strong><br>
						<p>We will provide updates as we move closer to opening our doors in Fall 2023. You can sign up for our email list <a href="#subscribe">here</a> to stay updated.</p>

					<!-- Virtues -->
					<section class="box features" id="virtues">
						<h2 class="major"><span>Core Virtues</span></h2>
						<p>G.K. Chesterton once responded to the question, “What’s wrong with the world today?” by answering: “I am.” At Columbus Classical Academy, our pursuit of virtue is predicated upon this humbling truth.</p>

						<p>Those who invoke virtue and insist on the reality of a moral law often are perceived as self-righteous prudes. The reputation is not entirely unearned. Often those with a conscience sensitive to the created moral order take on an air of superiority rather than the introspection that such knowledge demands. We acknowledge that in our hypocrisy, we are not quick enough to recognize and correct our own depravity before we decry it in others.</p>

						<p>Yet, as the old adage goes, “hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue.” And so, the answer to hypocrisy is not the dismantling of virtue, as some would have it, but the humble acknowledgment of our own iniquity along with the intentional formation of good and virtuous habits that help build the character to resist our vices. This requires a knowledge of what is good and right and a desire to conform our lives to it, even though we inevitably will fall short.</p>

						<p>Many moral and political ideologies ascendant today, however, respond either by redefining virtue as the unqualified pursuit of self-interest, or by preemptively laying the line of demarcation between good and evil along boundaries of social status, identity, or material wealth, so that the very capacity for virtue becomes a function of cultural power rather than a matter of personal conduct—those who identify with the class of “innocents” are beyond reproach, while all others are beyond redemption.</p>

						<p>These distortions are not exclusive to the political left or right. Ayn Rand’s objectivist libertarianism declares the atomizing “Virtue of Selfishness” just as Marxist humanism proclaims the balkanizing virtue of revolutionary class struggle.</p>

						<p>After a decade of imprisonment, torture, and exile at the hands of the Soviet Union, Alexandr Solzhenitsyn understood not that his oppressors were uniquely wicked or that he and his fellow victims were simply good, but instead that “[t]he line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart….” His, theirs, yours, and mine.</p>

						<p>At Columbus Classical Academy, our pursuit of virtue is not about planting a flag of self-righteousness, but rather about planting the seeds of humility. For this reason, everything we do starts and ends with a focus on the moral formation of our students in light of the seven classical virtues.</p>

					<p><strong style="font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 18pt;">Each visual mark in the Columbus Classical Academy shield reminds us of our mission.</strong></p>
					
					<!-- <img class=right style="box-shadow: none;" src="images/cca.jpg"> -->
					<center><img src="images/cca.jpg" width="30%"></center>
					

					<h3>The Shape</h3>

					<p>The shield is classical in nature and a tool of defense. It reminds us that a virtuous life is the best defense of our freedom as both an individual and as society. It reminds us that these things—the good, the true, and the beautiful—are worth defending.</p>

					<h3>The Torch</h3>

					<p>The torch is a reminder that education illuminates our mind and brings us into the light of truth. The torch reminds us of our classical heritage—we are a part of something older and greater than just our times, or even the classical world of antiquity which we are inheriting. We are a part of something eternal. We have both received this torch from previous generations and will pass the torch to subsequent ones.</p>

					<h3>The Colors</h3>

					<p>The colors are those of our nation. Our nation was founded on these classical principles, and we believe in the inseparable role classical education plays in the thriving of our nation. We look to the past in Hillsdale’s distinctly American classical education model. And we look to the future good of our country for which we are pursuing this education.

					<h3>Truth</h3>

					<p>We are pursuing Truth. We desire Truth. We know there is objective Truth that can be known. We know that the Truth will set us free, and only in this freedom can we live abundantly.</p>

					<h3>Virtue</h3>

					<p>Knowing this Truth will lead us into a more virtuous life. Virtue, in turn, allows us to better know the Truth. By pursuing our 7 school <a href="#virtues">virtues</a> we will become worthy of undertaking pursuit of the great transcendentals: the Good, the True, and the Beautiful.

	<!-- Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ,
vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.
Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ,
Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos
misericordes oculos ad nos converte;
Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui,
nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.
O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. -->
